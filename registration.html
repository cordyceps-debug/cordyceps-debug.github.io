      <strong>What about bad weather?</strong> The short answer: As the Norwegians say, there is no bad weather; 
      there are only bad clothing choices. If you’re properly dressed, you can enjoy all sorts of weather!
      The long answer: We’re prepared. We have a kit list for different weather situations. We check the weather 
      forecast (and encourage parents to check as well – and involve your kids – it can open up great science 
      discussions and also give children a sense that they can make educated guesses about the future, and 
      prepare themselves for it). We’re also big fans of spare socks.

      Kids love being outside in almost any weather – it’s adults who tend to think of rain or chilly air as 
      inconvenient. When children are properly outfitted, they can safely enjoy the pleasures of raindrops, 
      puddles, mud, icicles, and gusts of wind.

      If you’re on this website and you’ve read this far, you probably value getting kids outside and into nature. 
      We shouldn’t feel “at the mercy” of the weather; the variety of weather phenomena is a feast for the senses, 
      not an inconvenience. Foggy days, rainy  days, etc let children (and adults!) see a familiar place in a 
      (literally) new light.

      That said, if there are weather situations that present a clear health risk, such as extreme heat or cold, 
      significant hail, or lightning, we may reschedule certain sessions.

        <strong>What about literacy?</strong> Pen and paper are not the only tools for learning literacy 
        (and numeracy!). Experiential learning, handling objects, etc, all lead to a solid understanding of 
        basic mathematical concepts, and we’ve never seen a nature school whose participants don’t make letters 
        out of sticks and write their names in the dirt. Fostering curiosity is more useful in the long term 
        than trying to get kids to read as early as possible in the name of some vague ”headstart”.
    <br><br>
        <strong>What about toilets?</strong> We love bushcraft and connecting with nature, but we also love 
        hygiene and modern plumbing. Our forest school sessions are, whenever possible, held at a location with 
        accessible (flush!) toilets, sinks, and soap. If a location doesn’t have washrooms, we recommend making 
        a pit stop at home beforehand.
   <br><br>
        <strong>What about laundry?</strong> Does forest school sound too good to be true, like there must be a 
        catch somewhere? This is it. We’re not going to beat around the bush; your child will be bringing home 
        lots of  muddy clothes.
