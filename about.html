        <h1>What is FOREST SCHOOL?</h1>
        <p>Forest school, also known as <i>nature kindergarten, adventure school, Waldkindergarten, </i>etc, 
            is a program in which children spend their time outdoors in all weather, playing freely rather 
            than following a teacher-centered curriculum. There are numerous benefits to spending time outdoors 
            engaged in self-directed play. It develops gross- and fine-motor skills, creativity, and resilience 
            against boredom. The movement as practiced in Scandinavia and Northern Europe has been around for 
            50+ years, and is quickly growing new roots in North America.
         <br><br>
         It is crucial to note that many of the principles valued by forest school theory are intrinsic to 
            Indigenous peoples’ pedagogy and relationship with nature, and therefore, Indigenous ‘forest school’ 
            has been practiced in North America for ages before the recent advent of Scandinavian-inspired 
            schools such as Riversong.</p>

                    <strong>Megan</strong> grew up in trees and snow forts, benefiting from countless 
                    hours of outdoor free play thanks to her parents’ refrain of “go play outside – just 
                    be home in time for supper.” She has taught Mandarin Chinese at CEGEP and university, 
                    and worked for a UN specialized agency. Most importantly, since discovering the concept 
                    of forest school, she has been testing out and refining forest school practices with her 
                    own family.
